To sign:

Run the "prepare" command file to build and sign the cab file.  The signed cab file will be in the "disk1" folder.

Log on to:

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/hardware/Driver/

Using the Azure account login- in my case it's:

matt@echoaudioazure.onmicrosoft.com


Submit a new driver and upload the cab file.  Tick all the "Windows 10 Client x64" options.



What about weird garbage files from makecab?
