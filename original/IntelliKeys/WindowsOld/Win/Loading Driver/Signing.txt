To sign:

Run the "prepare" command file to build and sign the cab file.  The signed cab file will be in the "disk1" folder.  Verify that the cab file has a digital signature (right-click, select Properties, and check in the Digital Signatures tab).

Log on to:

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/hardware/Driver/

Using the Azure account login- in my case it's:

matt@echoaudioazure.onmicrosoft.com


Submit a new driver and upload the cab file.  Tick all the "Windows 10 Client x64" options for 64-bit Windows 10.  For 32-bit Windows 10, tick all the options that are *not* x64 and *not* ARM64.
